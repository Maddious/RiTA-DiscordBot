## Deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
To deploy a free translation bot that you can add to your discord server, follow these easy steps.

#### 1. Fork this repo.
* If you don't yet have a github account, [create one](https://github.com/join)! It's free and easy.
* Use the button in the upper righthand side of this page to fork the repo so that it will be associated with your github account.

#### 2. Create a new [Discord App](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create)
* Give app a friendly name and click the **Create App** button
  * I like the name **C-3PO**, but feel free to pick something different if you fear George Lucas's wrath. Maybe **C-4PO**
* Take note of the app **CLIENT ID**, you will need it later
* Scroll down to the **Bot** section
* Click the **Create a Bot User** button
* Click the **Yes, do it!** button
* Copy the bot's **TOKEN**, you will need it later

#### 3. Create a [Heroku account](https://id.heroku.com/signup/login) (It's free!)
* Create a new app. It's name must be unique and composed of all lowercase letters and dashes. Something like `yourname-discordbot` is fine
* Under **Deployment Method** select Github. Connect to your github account and search for this repo by name.
* Scroll down to the manual deploy section, and select the **heroku-deployment** branch. Click deploy branch, and wait for the successfully deployed message.
* Go to the **Resources** tab and look for the addons section. Search 'Postgres', and add a 'Hobby Dev - Free' version of Heroku Postgres. This will be automatically attached as your bot's database. 
* Go to the **Settings** tab. Click to reveal Config Variables, then add a new one. The key will be **DISCORD_TOKEN**, and the value will be your discord bot's token that you copied earlier.
* Go to the **Overview** tab and click configure dynos. Turn off the default `web npm start` dyno and turn on the `worker node src/bot.js` dyno. Your bot will now be up and running!

#### 4. Invite your bot to your server and configure it!
* Replace the CLIENTID string in the following url with your own apps client id: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=CLIENTID&scope=bot&permissions=8
* Vist the resulting url and add your bot to any server where you have admin privileges.
* Once added, your bot should show up more or less instantaneously. Type `!t help` within the discord chat for more details on how to use it. Happy translating!

#### 5. Troubleshooting
* You can set up debugging webhooks using the following steps
    1. Create a new channel on your server to recieve the webhooks, let's say `#webhooks`.
    2. Go to Server Settings -> Webhooks -> Create Webhook. Select the `#webhooks` channel, then copy the webhook's URL. It will look something like `https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/012345678901234567/VCj9yOOtJF9VCm-BU2F9xrbnoWD5gBZZ-UU1mZHcxi5VLgr3bPb9NanRJM8YD9cpBisL`
    3. In the **Settings** tab of your Heroku app add the following Config Variables (values extracted from your URL):
        * **DISCORD_DEBUG_WEBHOOK_ID** : 012345678901234567
        * **DISCORD_DEBUG_WEBHOOK_TOKEN** : VCj9yOOtJF9VCm-BU2F9xrbnoWD5gBZZ-UU1mZHcxi5VLgr3bPb9NanRJM8YD9cpBisL
    4. Restart your app's `worker node src/bot.js` dyno, and you will begin to recieve debugging messages in your `#webhooks` channel.
* If your bot in unresponsive, the first thing to check is Heroku. Log in and manually restart the `worker node src/bot.js` dyno. 
* For further troubleshooting, it's helpful to install the Heroku command line interface. Once installed you can login from a terminal with `heroku login` and check your apps logs with `heroku logs --tail -a <your-app-name>`
* If you are unable to solve a problem yourself, report it with as much detail as possible in this repo's issue tracker.
