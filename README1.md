## <a name="new"></a>Whats New
For full History, See [Changelog](https://github.com/ZyC0R3/RitaBot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

#### New in 1.2.1-\*
* New commands added (embed, bot2bot, settings updatedb)
  * embed command allows you to change the type of message that is sent to the translation channel, in embed format or standard text. Standard text shows the users avatar and name instead of the bot.
  * bot2bot allows for messages sent from other bots, in non embedded format to be translated as well. (Due to limitation this has been implimented but is disabled for now)
  * As the new variables above are stored in the database, they need new Columns to be added, as such updatedb will complete these actions.
* Major code changes, new code implementations will change the DB and produce errors on first build, but this is a safe version to update to. Follow the below instructions.
  * Step 1: Make a pull request and update from **Master** branch. 
    * Once you update the bot and it initializes you WILL get a db error, this is normal. (we are working on suppressing these)
  * Step 2: `!t settings updatedb`
    * This will throw another error but it will build the missing columns.
    * The default value for embed is on and botbot is off.
    * Running this multiple times will cause error to be posted to webhook chan, this is a "Value exists" error. Preventing you from destroying the DB
  * Step 3: Completed, and now working.
    * Once you have completed Step 2, the bot will have come online, but it wont have fully Initialised. 
    * To prevent a never ending loop of errors, the VERY FIRST message or command sent on the server will Initialise the DB fully. Meaning you will have to send that message again.
      * Please Note Due to [Automatic dyno restarts](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#automatic-dyno-restarts) the first message after each restart will share the same behaviour as above.
* Added in command triggers and command deletion to clean up command channels.
* Custom Emoji's are now supported and will be sent with the translated message correctly, with the exception of a few languages.
* DM Translation have been disabled as it has been identified they never worked as intended. they will be re-introduced in a later update.
* Various Security vulnerabilities fixed.
* Dev Dependencies core to this bot, the `google-translate-api` & `google-translate-token` & `gulp-watch`have been updated
* `eslint` has been replaced with `babel-eslint`
* `!t settings updatebot` Has been **DISABLED** - This is not needed as of yet and with the similarities to the `!t settings updatedb` command it may cause issues.
* Deploy with Heroku Setup and integration. 

#### New in 1.2.0-\*
* No Code changes, just URL updates for New name of Bot
* Published to NPM
* Non code changes will be appended with Version-\*\* from now on.
* Various Spelling mistakes in ReadMe have been corrected.
* Dev Dependencies core to this bot, the `google-translate-api` & `google-translate-token` have been updated
* Setup on a Raspberry Pi instruction Section added.
* gulp-watch updated dependencies. (*Moved to Local repository as it was out-of-date and full of Security Issues.*)
* Patch for Chinese language support.
* Various Security vulnerabilities fixed.
* Various commands re-activated.

## <a name="features"></a>Features
* Translate custom messages
* Translate messages by reacting with flag emoji
* Translate last message(s) in channel
* Translate to multiple languages at once
* Automatic translation of channels with option to forward translations to users or separate channels.
* Supports 100+ languages
* Send translations using author username and avatar using Webhooks
* Send files to other channels
* Cross-server translations (Please Contact Artanis_#2340 regarding this)

## <a name=""></a>Usage
* Create your own with the instructions below.
* Write `!translate help` or `!t help` for a list of commands.
* Enter the command `!t help modules` to get a list of all help commands, these show how to use each command.

## <a name="deploy"></a>Setting up a Bot with "Deploy to Heroku"

This Method does not need you to Fork this repository, you can run your bot straight off of the Rita Master Branch. For update instructions click [here](#update)

#### 1. Create a new [Discord App](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)
* Give app a friendly name and click the **Create App** button
  * I like the name **C-3PO**, but feel free to pick something different if you fear George Lucas's wrath. Maybe **C-4PO**
* Take note of the apps **CLIENT ID**, you will need it later
* Scroll down to the **Bot** section
* Click the **Create a Bot User** button
* Click the **Yes, do it!** button
* Copy the bot's **TOKEN**, you will need it later

#### 2. Deploy to Heroku

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Zyc0r3/RitaBot)

* In the custom variable of **DISCORD_TOKEN** put in the copied token of your created bot.
* **DO NOT CHANGE** the **NODE_MODULES_CACHE** Variable unless you know about Heroku Caching.
* If you with to use Webhook Debug logging:
  * Fill in **DISCORD_DEBUG_WEBHOOK_ID** & **DISCORD_DEBUG_WEBHOOK_TOKEN**, For instructions go [here](#troubleshooting)
* Once installed, Go to the **Overview** tab and click configure dynos. Turn off the default `web npm start` dyno and turn on the `worker node src/bot.js` dyno. Your bot will now be up and running!

#### 3. Invite your bot to your server and configure it!
* Replace the CLIENTIDGOESHERE string in the following URL with your own apps client id from Step 1: 
  * https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=CLIENTIDGOESHERE&scope=bot&permissions=8
* Visit the resulting URL and add your bot to any server where you have admin privileges.
* Once added, your bot should show up more or less instantaneously. Type `!t help` within the discord chat for more details on how to use it. Happy translating!

## <a name="new-bot"></a>Setting up a Bot Manually

**To deploy a free translation bot that you can add to your discord server, follow these easy steps.**

## <a name="dbm"></a>How to Update your Database Manually
With 1.2.1 there comes a change to the database, the Servers table needs to new columns.

You can run the `!t updatedb` to do this automatically, or if you want to do this manually then there are certain formats you need to use to have the database work correctly. Below you can find the SQL queries you will need to run to create these.

#### For Heroku, if you are using Postgres Admin 4 as your method of database editor: 
See [Heroku Database Support](#database) for more info
* **`ALTER TABLE public.servers ADD COLUMN "embedstyle" character varying(8) COLLATE pg_catalog."default" DEFAULT 'on'::character varying;`**
* **`ALTER TABLE public.servers ADD COLUMN "bot2botstyle" character varying(8) COLLATE pg_catalog."default" DEFAULT 'off'::character varying;`**

#### For a local builds and a Local database:
* **`ALTER TABLE servers ADD COLUMN "embedstyle" character varying(8)  DEFAULT 'on'`**
* **`ALTER TABLE servers ADD COLUMN "bot2botstyle" character varying(8) DEFAULT 'off'`**

## <a name="migration"></a>C-3PO to RITA Bot Migration
**If you already have a Heroku Bot Using C-3P0**

#### 1. Checklist
* Make sure you have completed the following steps before attempting to migrate translation settings.
1. You have an already up and running C-3P0 Bot.
2. You are using Heroku to run the old version.
3. Make sure you do not disable, reset or delete your database (preferably Postgres from Heroku)
4. You have already completed a Pull Request from the master Branch of ZyC0R3/Rita to your master branch.

#### 2. Migrate
* Go to Heroku and click your app of C-3PO, and locate the **Deploy** section. Scroll down until you see the current fork your C-3PO bot is running off of, next to it there should be a button saying **Disconnect**
* Next click search on repositories and select your fork of this project and wait for it to load. Once that is completed you need to **Deploy** the 'Master' Branch/Version of the bot.
* Wait for it to finish deploying and you should be good to go. Turn on your worker dyno (if it was not already) and make sure your DISCORD_TOKEN is connected in the variables section in Settings. All data from your previous C-3PO bot should be saved in the database of Postgres as long as you do not delete it and will connect to all the previous channel translation connections. Happy Translating!

## <a name="database"></a>Heroku Database Support
Sometimes you need to edit the Database manually, This is not something you should be playing around with unless you really know what you are doing.

#### 1. Checklist
1. Know that you are doing, if you don't then **don't** touch the DB. Simple.
2. Download and Install Postgres Admin 4, Located [Here](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) or [Here](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/pgadmin/pgadmin4/). *This guide will be for Windows, but it shouldn't be much different for any other OS.*
3. Locate your credentials for you Heroku Database, Log in to **Heroku** > Select your **App** > Click **Resources** > Click **Heroku Postgres** > Click **Settings** > Click **View Credentials** (*Note: Heroku rotates credentials periodically and updates applications where this database is attached.*)

#### 2. Connect
For a fresh install of pgAdmin, the dashboard likely contains only one server. This is your local server, Ignore this.
1. Right click server(s) > create > server …
2. Fill out the following:
  * **Name:** This is solely for you. Name it whatever you want, I chose ‘Heroku-Run — On’

*Under the connection tab:*
  * **Hostname/Address:** This is the host credential you located in Step 3. It should look like \*\*-\*\*-\*\*...amazonaws.com
  * **Port:** Keep the port at 5432, unless your credentials list otherwise
  * **Maintenance databaseL** This is the database field located in Step 3 Below.
  * **Username:**  This is the user field in the credentials
  * **Password:** The password field located in Step 3. I highly advise checking save password so that you don’t have to copypasta this every time you want to connect.
  * In the **SSL Tab**, mark SSL mode as require

At this point, if we were to hit ‘save’ (please don’t), something very strange would happen. You’d see hundreds if not thousands of databases appear in pgAdmin. This has to do with how Heroku configures their servers. You’ll still only have access to your specific database, not those of others. In order to avoid parsing so many databases, we have to white list only those databases we care about.

1. Go to the **Advanced** tab and under db restriction copy the database name (it’s the same value as the **Maintenance Database** field filled earlier).
2. Click Save/Connect and you are done. Edit away.

## <a name="local"></a>Local Installation Support
The bot can also be run locally without Heroku. The local setup requires more steps since the database needs to be setup and the development tools need be installed. Start with the steps 1 and 2 in [Setting up a New Bot](#new-bot) and the continue as follows:

#### 1. Create a local database
Any Database that runs with SQL Sequelize ('https://sequelize.org/master/') can be used. My recommendation is to use the [SQL Lite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database since the setup is fast and access is easy. Copy the connection details to the database for the next step. Example: The connection to a sqlite database with the name *database.db* stored at the same level of this README file would be *./database.db*.

#### 2. Create a new .env File
Copy the existing **.env.example** file and name it **.env**. Edit the Values of **DISCORD_TOKEN**, **DISCORD_BOT_OWNER_ID** and the **DATABASE_URL** according to the values that you copied earlier.
  * DATABASE_URL needs to be the path to the database file (once you install SQLite it will create a database for you in the path you put...)
  * Example -  DATABASE_URL = C:\Admin\Rita_Development\test.db

#### 3. Install nodejs
Install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/  

#### 4. Run and start the bot
Run `npm install -g gulp` in your console to install gulp. Build the bot code using `npm run-script build` and run the bot with `npm run-script start` in the command consolde.
*Make sure the command console is specific to the RITA Folder*

#### 5. Invite your bot to your server and configure it!
* Replace the CLIENTID string in the following URL with your own apps client id: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=CLIENTID&scope=bot&permissions=8
* Visit the resulting URL and add your bot to any server where you have admin privileges.
* Once added, your bot should show up more or less instantaneously. Type `!t help` within the discord chat for more details on how to use it. Happy translating!

## <a name="pi"></a>Setup on a Raspberry Pi
We recommend to initially run your bot in a local environment on your laptop before you run the translator on a Raspberry Pi. The local setup allows you to get familiar with the setup and the settings.

The following description allows a headless configuration. Only a network connection is required. This description is explicitly for running the bot on a Raspberry Pi 4, but the setup should be similar for earlier version.

Recommendation: run it locally first before putting the code on pi. Easier to ensure that .env variables are setup correctly.

#### 1. Write Raspbian on your SD card
Download the minimal image of Raspbian (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). This setup is based on Raspbian Buster Lite, July 2019.

Use balenaEtcher(https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to write the image on your SD card.

For more Information: See https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md

#### 2. Enable SSH
Enable SSH by placing a file named “ssh” (without any extension) onto the boot partition of the SD card.

#### 3. Start and Login
* Pop your prepared SD card, power and a network cable into the Pi.
* Find your Pi's IP Address. Check your Router's DHCP allocation table or use a mobile app like Fing (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing) to find the IP of Pi.
* Install WinSCP and Putty on your Laptop.
* Start Putty and login into your Pi. Username: pi, PW: raspberry. Change your password with 'passwd'.

#### 4. Initial Setup
* Type `raspi-config` and change your locales
* Update the package lists from repositories: `sudo apt-get update`
* Update your repositories: `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`

#### 5. Install node and npm
The fastes way to install the current node and npm versions (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) was to follow the description from nodesource (https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md):
* Get the source: `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`
* Install: `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
* Check version: `node -v` and `npm -v`

#### 6. Get the code
It is recommend to install git and pull from your fork or main:
* Install git: `sudo apt-get install git`
* Create the folder for the source: `mkdir Rita`
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ZyC0R3/RitaBot.git`
* Checkout the branch you need: `git checkout --track origin/1.2.0-6`

Alternative: move the source code with WinSCP from your local environment to the Pi.

#### 7. Install the database
Install sqlite3 with `sudo apt-get install sqlite3`.

Create an empty database file (`sqlite3 database.db`)and call `.tables`)

#### 8. Copy your .env
Use WinSCP to copy your .env file from your local environment to the Pi.

#### 9. Run the code
* Install gulp is installed: `sudo npm install -g gulp` (not sure if still necessary)
* Make sure you are in the Rita folder
* Get and install all packages of RITA: `npm install`
* Build the code: `npm run-script build`
* Start the bot: `npm run-script start`

#### 10. Autostart
There are different ways to make the bot initialize at startup. The following description is based on `init.d` and `update-rc.d`:
* Create a `init.d` script: Edit the script template in `.pi/translate_bot` if necessary and copy it to the folder `/etc/init.d/` with `sudo mv .pi/translate_bot /etc/init.d/.`
* Make the file executable: `sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/translate_bot`
* Update the system script links: `sudo update-rc.d translate_bot defaults`
* Now, you can interact with the bot service with commands `sudo service translate_bot start`,  `sudo service translate_bot status` and `sudo service translate_bot stop`
* The logging will be in `/var/log/translate_bot.err` and `/var/log/translate_bot.log`
* Reboot and hope everything is running smooth: `sudo reboot`
* Enjoy (or return to step 4 in [Setting up a New Bot](#new-bot) if you haven't done yet)

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting
* You can set up debugging Webhooks using the following steps
    1. Create a new channel on your server to receive the Webhooks, let's say `#Webhooks`.
    2. Go to Server Settings -> Webhooks -> Create Webhook. Select the `#Webhooks` channel, then copy the Webhook's URL. It will look something like `https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/012345678901234567/VCj9yOOtJF9VCm-BU2F9xrbnoWD5gBZZ-UU1mZHcxi5VLgr3bPb9NanRJM8YD9cpBisL`
    3. In the **Settings** tab of your Heroku app add the following Config Variables (values extracted from your URL):
        * **DISCORD_DEBUG_WEBHOOK_ID** : 012345678901234567
        * **DISCORD_DEBUG_WEBHOOK_TOKEN** : VCj9yOOtJF9VCm-BU2F9xrbnoWD5gBZZ-UU1mZHcxi5VLgr3bPb9NanRJM8YD9cpBisL
    4. Restart your app's `worker node src/bot.js` dyno, and you will begin to receive debugging messages in your `#Webhooks` channel.
* If your bot in unresponsive, the first thing to check is Heroku. Log in and manually restart the `worker node src/bot.js` dyno.
* For further troubleshooting, it's helpful to install the Heroku command line interface. Once installed you can login from a terminal with `heroku login` and check your apps logs with `heroku logs --tail -a <your-app-name>`
* If you are unable to solve a problem yourself, report it with as much detail as possible in this repository's issue tracker.

## <a name="credits-&-license"></a>Credits & License

This project was originally released by Aziz under the MIT license. He chose to take the project private/commercial at version 0.4.2 Beta. Bobby Johnson forked the project and renamed it Louie after his dog. AlooAkbar forked Louie and added the necessary modifications for simple and free deployment of the bot using Heroku. ZyC0R3 Picked up the fork and as part of a team fixed over 200 errors and brought it in to the modern age, All would like to thank Aziz for his hard work and making these early versions OSS so that others may learn and build on his hard work to share with the community.

## <a name="history"></a>What is Rita and who are we?

*Rita is the culmination of many things, it started with a mobile game, a community of gamers, a discord server of different languages and a desire to all be understood. She is a Real-Time Translator Bot for use on Discord, Self-hosted on Heroku (or a local install) and Completly **100%** Free. She is maintained by a small group of users, each with different backgrounds and some learning as we go.*

#### Why did you make Rita?

*The mobile game itself would get old, fast. The community around it, however, is what kept us going. The one downside was we didn't all speak the same language. The game we played translated our conversations for us but Discord didn't, so the server admins used a  translation bot called C-3P0. This introduction is the start of the story.*

#### The history of Rita?

*There are loads of different translation bots out there, some are amazing, some are expensive, some are free but have limits, and others are just rubbish. C-3P0 checked all these boxes.*

*Originally called discord-translator and made by Aziz, then forked By NotMyself and renamed Louie, forked again By AlooAkbar and renamed C-3P0, its code was neglected, not maintained, left outdated and iterations made private for commercial gains.*

#### Why Rita and what does it stand for?

*I and a group of fellow C-3P0 users decided that collectively we could do better, plagued with crashes, API changes, relentless bugs and issues, the drive to make something better was born.*

*Rita's history and various iterations each added something extra, it just needed to be brought together and molded, molded into something amazing, moulded into Rita. The Real-Time Interchangeable Translating Assistant.*

#### *There you have it, the story, dramatised and electrified for effect, but all true, of how Rita was born.*
